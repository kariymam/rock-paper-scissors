# rock-paper-scissors

Learning Typescript by building a Rock, Paper, Scissors game based on FreeCodeCamp's Rock Paper Scissors 

## Setup

Typescript and Nodemon installed globally converting to Javascript OOTB.

## Goals

1. Get a better understanding of the difference between Typescript and Javascript without getting too deep into a rabbit hole
2. Make something aesthetically interesting
